Hello! Thank you for taking the time out to help with my project :)

The task here relates to Text 2 SQL (Converting a sentence into a SQL query)

"Who is player with jersey 42?" -> "SELECT * from _ where jersey = 42"

Given that users will not always type full sentences, and would instead issue queries like "player 42" or "player jersey 42" etc, we want some data to evaluate the performance of our model and this is where YOU come in.

In the data provided to you, there is the original query and a simplified query (Generated by a model) along with the desired SQL and the first 3 rows of the table.

The simplified query is noisy and isn't usually correct and we would like you to modify it such that a human can easily convert that sentence to the SQL.

The original query is the long-form version given just for your reference. Note that the simplified query only needs to map directly to the SQL and does not need to be equivalent to the original query.

Some VERY important things to keep a note of:
    1. It should be obvious from the query which column should be selected
    2. Pay attention to the table to check for ambiguities, for example, sample ID 500 has multiple numeric columns so we need to specify which column we want to filter by
    3. Queries do not need to make grammatical sense
    4. Please read all samples carefully before annotating
    5. Look at the Table and the simplified text to see if you can arrive at the query (Including the aggregation operation (COUNT, MIN, etc)
    6. In case the gold SQL itself does not make sense, then mark it as red so that I know to ignore it (example


Some desired properties of simplification:
    1. We would like to not specify where column names wherever avoidable.
    2. We would like it to be short and not contain needless stop words.

Please EDIT only the 3rd column (simplified column) with the changes to match the query in the next column

You don't need to follow the ORIGINAL : ... EDITED : ...,(As suggested in samples) you can simply edit the same cell with your change
